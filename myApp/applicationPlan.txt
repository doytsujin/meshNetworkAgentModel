The simulation:

Interface (what the user can manipulate):
- the initial population size
- the ratio of different initial strategies in the population (may also be random)
- fitness criterium for the genetic algorithm 
- amount of epochs for which the simulation is to be run (step-wise also possible) 
- the load the users introduce to the network

View (what the user sees):
- the interface 
- the simulation with symbolic agents moving in real time
- the connections between the agents when a message is sent - a connection = data traveling on the network (is such visualisation necessary? Might be difficult to make it readable) 
- after the simulation has run the results (eg. ratios of surviving strategies) 
- the results are also exported in a format which makes it easy to process them later

Model:
- the routing algorithm 
- the battery life model
- the agents
	- the agent's movement model
	- the strategies of the agents - behaviour
	- scorekeeping system (each agent remembers how successful it was)
- the genetic algorithm
